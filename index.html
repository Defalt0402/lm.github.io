          <p>Hi, I'm Lewis! I'm currently an undergraduate student at the <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/">University of Manchester</a>, in the UK, studying for a Computer Science degree.
          I've always had an interest in computers, ever since I first started playing with Scratch in primary school. Since then, I've created a few different projects, some of which I will
          post on this website. Any future projects I make should also eventually appear here, now that I have a clear understanding of how the development process works.</p>

        <div class="about-two">
          <p>As well as computing projects, I also have an interest in art. My main art style is physical, creating paintings, drawings, and more recently crochet and amigurumi.
          These are all ways for me to express my creativity, and create work that I'm happy with. For me, art is used for fun: <br><br><b class="quote">It doesn't need to be "good". It doesn't need to be something
          that other people like. Art is for the creator.</b></p>
